I need to create a web app.
It should use the design system I uploaded to the project knowledge.
The web app comprises a grid of video feeds from an array of solar-powered surveillance cameras that can capture images and livestream construction sites.
It should include the video grid, a search bar, filters, alerts, account settings, a timeline, and dashboard configuration settings.

Design:
* Dark mode / Light mode toggle support
* Responsive
* Subtle, smooth
* Minimal, clean aesthetic
* Status badges
* Thoughtful, consistent iconography

Search bar:
* Lets the user type in objects, activities, events that they want to find from the media captured by these cameras
* Supports auto-complete / type ahead
* Able to be connected to Google Gemini (eventually, but not required for MVP) to take user's search as input into various Gemini-supported models

Layout flexibility:
* Camera Feeds can be dragged around to place them in any order that I cant
* Ability to select the number of camera feeds per row, fullscreen

Utility functions:
* A button to start or stop live streaming on all cameras

Each Camera Feed:
* Has metadata available on hover (or similarly progressively disclosed interaction method)
   * Camera name
   * Project (Jobsite) name
   * Timestamp
   * Camera Online/Offline status
   * Camera battery percentage

Alerts:
* An expandable/collapsible side pane that lists alerts based on the video contents
   * Timestamp
   * Detected activity name and type
   * Motion-triggered activity

Responsiveness:
* As a user, I want the dashboard to be fully functional and optimized on desktop, mobile, tablet, and TV screens so I can access and monitor my cameras from any device.

Let's begin with creating a simple index.html file to lock down the design before we transition to making the web app functional. The first priority is to align on the design direction and vision.

DSDEV Camera Dashboard Project Continuation
Project Overview
I'm building a web-based surveillance camera dashboard for DSDEV that monitors solar-powered cameras on construction sites. The dashboard displays a grid of live video feeds with real-time alerts and comprehensive filtering capabilities.
Current Status
We've completed the initial HTML/CSS design phase with a fully styled, responsive dashboard. The current implementation includes:
Completed Features:

2x2 default camera grid (expandable to 1x1, 3x3, 4x4 layouts)
Dark/light mode toggle with persistent theme storage
Drag-and-drop camera feed reordering
Collapsible alerts panel showing recent detection events
Advanced search with categorized autocomplete (Detections: People/Vehicles/Machinery, Activities: Construction operations)
Multi-level filtering system (Camera Status, Alert Types, Projects)
Real-time timestamp updates
Battery level indicators with color-coded warnings
Online/offline camera status
Streaming start/stop controls with visual feedback

Design System:

Primary accent: Orange (#f79837)
Background: Warm gray palette (#0b0a09 dark, #fdfdfc light)
Typography: Manrope font family
Consistent 2px stroke icons with rounded caps
Subtle shadows and smooth transitions
Mobile-first responsive design

Next Phase Requirements
Immediate Need:
Replace placeholder camera icons with actual media content:

Static images for offline/paused cameras
Short looping video clips for "live" feeds
Maintain 16:9 aspect ratio
Ensure smooth loading and performance

Upcoming Features to Implement:

Google Gemini Integration: Connect search functionality to Gemini AI models for intelligent object/activity recognition
Timeline Scrubber: Historical playback controls for reviewing past footage
Fullscreen Mode: Individual camera expansion capabilities
Account Settings: User profile and preferences management
Advanced Analytics: Motion heatmaps, activity reports, trend analysis
Multi-site Support: Switch between different construction projects
Mobile App Considerations: PWA capabilities for field access

Technical Requirements

Framework-agnostic HTML/CSS/JS (ready for React/Vue conversion)
API-ready structure for backend integration
WebRTC support for actual live streaming
Efficient state management for real-time updates
Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Design Principles

Minimal & Clean: Focus on content, reduce visual noise
Professional: Enterprise-grade appearance suitable for construction industry
Responsive: Seamless experience across desktop, tablet, mobile, and TV displays
Intuitive: Clear visual hierarchy and meaningful iconography
Performant: Smooth interactions even with multiple video feeds

Current Code Location
The complete HTML file with all styles and scripts is in an artifact titled "DSDEV Camera Dashboard". It uses vanilla JavaScript for interactions and CSS custom properties for theming.
Immediate Task
Please help me integrate placeholder images and video clips into the camera feed areas while maintaining the current design aesthetic and ensuring smooth performance. After this, we'll proceed with converting the static design into a functional web application with real backend integration.
